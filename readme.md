# Case Study

## Instructions
1. Create the controller for player movement in Controller.js.
    - The game is mobile based so the player has to move on touch events.
2. Inside CollisionChecker.js, implement collision detection by checking for collisions between the player and falling entities using the colliders when the player object is moved by the controller.
    - Consider using shapes or geometries to represent the boundaries of the player, which can be used to detect collisions with falling entities.
    - You can also detect collision by calculating the distance between the two objects or by using [ThreeJS OBB method](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_math_obb).
3. If the falling entity enters inside the player, destroy it and update the score with addPoint function in CollisionChecker.js.
